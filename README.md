## Run dev app

Run `npm start`, then open `http://localhost:8080`

You can change the standard webpack configurations from CLI easily with something like this: `npm start -- --open --port 8888`. However, it is better to change the respective npm scripts or `webpack.config.js` with these options, as per your need.

To enable Webpack Bundle Analyzer, do `npm run analyze` (production build).

To enable hot module reload, do `npm start -- --hmr`.

To change dev server port, do `npm start -- --port 8888`.

To change dev server host, do `npm start -- --host 127.0.0.1`

**PS:** You could mix all the flags as well, `npm start -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7070 --open --hmr`

For long time aurelia-cli user, you can still use `au run` with those arguments like `au run --env prod --open --hmr`. But `au run` now simply executes `npm start` command.

## Build for production

Run `npm run build`, or the old way `au build --env prod`. -->
